        <p>A rainbow is an arc of colour in the sky that can be seen when the sun shines through falling rain. The
            pattern of colours, called a spectrum, starts with red on the outside and changes through orange, yellow,
            green, blue, indigo, and violet on the inside. Sometimes a second, larger, dimmer rainbow is seen.</p>

        <p>A rainbow is created when white light is bent (refracted) while entering a droplet of water, split into
            separate colours, and reflected back. A rainbow is actually round like a circle. On the ground, the bottom
            part is hidden, but in the sky, like from a flying airplane, it can be seen as a circle around the point
            opposite the Sun</p>
        <hr width="500px;" size="5">>
        <p>The rainbow effect can be seen when there are water drops in the air and the sun is giving light at the back
            of the observer at a low distance up or angle. Rainbows always appear opposite the Sun: they form circles
            around the shadow of your head (which is the point opposite the Sun).</p>
